# THESIS TEMPLATE
A minimalistic LaTeX template for theses.

## About
While writing my [MSc. thesis](https://linkwhenready.com), I could not find a
clean, simple, and minimalistic template, especially for bilingual universities. This template was written primarily with
[SabancÄ± University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/) requirements in mind, then
made as generic as possible. It can easily be adapted for other universities, or
for situations when the number of advisors/jury members is different.
